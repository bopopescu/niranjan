         <p >For any enterprise, the audit report is a key deliverable which shows the end results of the entire audit process. The users of financial statements like Investors, Lenders, Customers, and others base their decisions and plans on audit reports of any enterprise. An audit report is always critical to influencing the perceived value of any financial statementâ€™s audit.
