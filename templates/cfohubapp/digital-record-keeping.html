         <p >A majority of businesses are using digital record keeping in some form or another. There are a number of benefits to this, both to your practical, everyday operations, and your long-term, and even legal obligations. The transition to digital record keeping has been underway for a long time, but increased accessibility to storage and the resultant lowering of costs has continued to drive it forward.</p>
          <p>One of the main benefits of maintaining a digital filing system is the time and organizational resources saved by being able to easily search and access files on the computer. We will touch more on this later in the piece, but the searchability of files (some formats handle it better than other) is crucial to free up employee time and resources, allowing for a more efficient overall operational structure..</p>
          <p>You are limited only by the cost of virtual storage space, which can scale up in quite a cost-effective manner, in comparison to adding more physical square footage for your office or document storage facility. The growth of cloud storage solutions for enterprise level businesses in recent years has made digital record keeping an even more cost-effective option.</p>
          <p>Maintaining digital records of your dealings with customers and clients can safeguard your company in the event of a dispute. For example, you may want to retrieve copies of pertinent emails years later, in which case a digital document management system is ideal. Peernet offers a number of software solutions that make email to PDF or email to TIFF as easy as printing a document, as well as automated batch document conversion solutions.</p>
          <p>Maintaining digital records of sales, customer information and business details can be especially efficient in conjunction with business accounting software. This can cut down on time and resources that otherwise would be put towards the actions that drive your business forward.</p>
