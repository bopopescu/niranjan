         <p >Digital accounting is now more important than ever. Long gone are the days of paper records and excel spreadsheets and CFOHUB is at the forefront of embracing this efficient new digital accounting technology. 

As specialists in cloud based accounting, we can guide you through the transition from manual to digital accounting. CFOHUB offers friendly, helpful digital accounting services to help you streamline your finances and make managing your money as easy as possible.</p>
          <p>Digital and cloud based accounting is growing rapidly as technology continues to become a vital part of our everyday lives. HMRC’s ‘Making Tax Digital’ initiative has prompted a full rollout of digital accounting, which has meant for many that from April 2019 financial information has to be stored digitally and your taxes submitted through compliant software.</p>
          <p>Cloud based accounting systems allow you to keep all of your business records in one, easy-to-access online location. Not only can you open your accounts at the touch of a button, but you can also create and send invoices, keep up to date with payments, and much more. At CFOHUB, we specialise in digital cloud accounting software from Xero. We can not only help you to integrate Xero into your business processes, but we can also provide training to ensure you reap the benefits of digitalisation and everything Xero has to offer.</p>
